## Features

- multiple copy and paste
- copy with line number
- copy text without syntax
- smart copy
- copy as markdown code block

### multiple copy and paste

I just migrate code from [Multiple clipboards for VSCode](https://github.com/stef-levesque/vscode-multiclip) and make some optimizations

### copy with line number

You can use command: `Clipboard Master: copy with line number` to copy some content with line number.

### copy text without syntax

You can use command: `Clipboard Master: copy text without syntax` to copy selected text without syntax.

### smart copy

with command `Clipboard Master: Smart Copy`, you can:

- copy without syntax
- auto correct indent because some external editor can't deal with indent of paste code correctly

### copy as markdown code block

with command `Clipboard Master: Copy as Markdown Code Block`, you can:

- copy without syntax
- auto correct indent because some external editor can't deal with indent of paste code correctly
- detect the code language
